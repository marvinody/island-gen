# Island Gen
An old site I made when I was getting started with JS

## What Is?
A silly site that generates cool looking islands with configurable parameters. There's no exporting (other than saving as a picture) but it was meant more as a quick show-and-tell site rather than something that would actually be used for generate islands.

## Why?

I wrote this sometime around January 2017 according to my server's logs. I did not use git back then, I did not know JS best practices, I did not know a lot of things. I still made this after reading [this blog post][original-island-gen] because it inspired me.

Not keeping your code because you didn't know what you were writing back then seems wrong to me and I would like to save my growth (even though a lot of it is lost) as much as I can. It also is definitely one of the better looking sites I made and it's almost completely vanilla JS with just one dependency that manages settings change.

In this project, apparently I made like a hash router kinda deal from React from scratch which is frickin' amazing for me. This is why I love coding. You come up with a solution to something in a way that seems fitting at the time, then several years later, you find that the solution you came up with is ACTUALLY a solution that the smartest minds in the front-end world also came up with.
